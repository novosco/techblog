I met up with some of the team at Belfast NHS Trust to discuss their VDI experiences, they are currently running around 3000 users in production so itâ€™s a fairly decent sized deployment. We discussed topics such as why use VDI in healthcare, their challenges around providing a return on the investment and  the nuts and bolts of the technologies used in their environment. Its  a great case study for anyone interested in large scale VDI deployment particularly other NHS Trusts.
