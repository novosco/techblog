Novosco have been very successful with EMC’s new all flash offering in the pre-launch direct availability phase, we now have two NHS Trusts using Xbrick’s for large scale VDI deployments. EMC were keen to get us on board for the global launch event and asked our own Steven Johnston for his thoughts on our experiences with XtremIO. Check out the video here:
