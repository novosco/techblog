Just started a new project today for a customer where I will be building a 2 node DAG on Server 2012.

Got the Exchange server bits installed and then tried creating the DAG which failed.

After a bit of analysis it transpires that the customer built the base OS with Windows 2012 Standard and not DataCenter (Server 2012 doesnâ€™t include an Enterprise Edition any more)

Luckily we can convert between editions of Windows Server on the fly via DISM ( [Deployment Image Service & Management](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd744256%28v=ws.10%29.aspx "http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd744256%28v=ws.10%29.aspx"))

TechNet documentation on converting between server 2012 versions can be found [here](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/jj574204.aspx)

To determine the current edition of Windows Server installed run the following

- **DISM /online /Get-CurrentEdition**

To determine which versions the server can be upgraded to run

- **DISM /online /Get-TargetEditions**

As can be seen from the above screenshot this version of Windows Server can be upgraded to **Target Edition : ServerDatacenter**

To complete the conversion between editions we use the DISM command with the following format

- **DISM /online /Set-Edition:<Version> /ProductKey:XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX /AcceptEULA**

In the above example the target edition is **ServerDatacenter**

A reboot of the server and a check of the server edition reveals that is has indeed been successfully upgraded to DataCenter
