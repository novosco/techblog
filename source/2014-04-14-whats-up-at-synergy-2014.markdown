If you have never been to a  [Citrix Synergy](http://www.citrixsynergy.com/) event – Synergy is the best conference for Citrix engineers, sales and geeks everywhere. The event used to be held in both the USA and Europe until Citrix split up the event in the EU to 4-5 separate product days instead.

As you can imagine, the whole event is about the many great products in the Citrix portfolio. This has changed somewhat since my first one ten years ago when it was nearly all about Presentation Server, some remote access, best practice for terminal servers and what thin client worked best.

Today, the event is a very busy and full featured show with many industry leading products like  [XenDesktop](http://www.citrix.com/products/xendesktop/overview.html),  [ShareFile](http://www.citrix.com/products/sharefile/overview.html),  [XenMobile](http://www.citrix.com/products/xenmobile/overview.html),  [AppDNA](http://www.citrix.com/products/appdna/overview.html) and  [Netscaler](http://www.citrix.com/products/netscaler-application-delivery-controller/overview.html) being just a few.

In fact, the tricky part is fitting in everything you want to see in the three days. Along with experts on the various products and real customer experiences, you can also indulge in technical labs and even have a crack at some certifications in between sessions.

This year promises a feast of information and best practice for anyone interested in Mobility. With product like  [ShareFile](http://www.citrix.com/products/sharefile/overview.html),  [Worx Mail](http://www.citrix.com/products/worx-mobile-apps/overview.html) not to mention  [XenMobile](http://www.citrix.com/products/xenmobile/overview.html) taking up many of the sessions. There are also a load of specialist  [breakout sessions](http://blogs.citrix.com/2014/02/25/announcing-the-synergy-2014-guest-speakers/) focused on specific technologies from real live customers and partners. You can catch me at 1630 pm on Thursday 8th May talking about XenMobile use cases.

I’m looking forward to some exciting demos from  [Brad Peterson](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG_VSfIM1cg) – why do his demos always work?

What’s that? You can’t make it to LA? Don’t worry you can catch up on all the best sessions and demos at  [Citrix TV.](http://www.citrix.com/tv/)
