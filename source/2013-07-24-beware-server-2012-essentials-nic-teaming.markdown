Reading through the forums posts on TechNet [here](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsserver/en-US/cf8d66d3-5320-49bb-98ce-b8cad3e1e126/nic-teaming-supported "http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsserver/en-US/cf8d66d3-5320-49bb-98ce-b8cad3e1e126/nic-teaming-supported") & [here](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsserver/en-US/6d920fa5-9347-40b2-ace2-6791ed8d0c05/anywhere-access-cant-see-ipconfig "http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsserver/en-US/6d920fa5-9347-40b2-ace2-6791ed8d0c05/anywhere-access-cant-see-ipconfig") its down to the Wizard making WMI calls to get the IP address and this doesnâ€™t work properly when NIC teaming is used.

All in all its pretty poor when bugs like this get released in a RTM version of a product.
